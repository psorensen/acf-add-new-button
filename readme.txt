Create a new post without leaving the form your working on using a Relationship Field

== Description ==

**Requires the plug-in [Advanced Custom Fields](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/ "Awesome plug-in to manage custom fields").**

This is a very basic add-on to allow the ability for relationship fields that are associated with a single post-type, to be able to add a new
item without leaving the form your currently working with. Uses a colorbox pop-up to open the add new post window.

Usage:

* Install the plug-in
* Set up a relationship field with only one post-type
* Add a relationship field to a field group and the new ‘Add New’ button will show up on the field
* Click the Add New button to open Colorbox and add a new post
* Click the publish button to add the new item (or click the close button to cancel) and the Colorbox will close
* The newly added item will be available for selection in the relationship list
