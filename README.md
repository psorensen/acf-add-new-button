### Description

A plugin for ACF that adds an ‘Add New’ button to the Relationship Field so you can create a new post without leaving the form your working on.

Include a ‘Relationship Field‘ related to only one post and when working with your form you'll be able to add a new post for the related post type without leaving it. Click the ‘Add New’ button to open a pop-up, after you finish with the new post click the publish button (or close the pop-up to cancel) and the new item will be added.

The newly added item will be available for selection in the relationship list.
